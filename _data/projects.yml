    A Project that is created by me and Chakhon for the class ICS 111, We draw, plan, and code this game.

    My role in this project is the artist and the programmer. I was responsible for 70 % of the monster design and
    coding and java class. For the code part, I was responsible for damage indicator, score counter, movement, the
    balance of hero or monster,and the dice. The part that takes most time was the dice and damage indicator. Damage
    indicator was hard because it includes allthe monster and hero health, damage, and defend, and the display
    correctness on the screen. The dice was hard because I need to use sprite sheet which I was not sure how to use it,
    but after free try I know now.
